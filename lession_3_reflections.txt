When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I will use it when I am out of my home or not having my laptop with me and when I need to work with my friends

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This might curropt my files in local repos. so for me it is better to do this when I want to.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks used to make a copy in gitHub it self, Clones make copies in local machine for gitHub and branches are used to make different experimental sections in a project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
By knowing the last known state copy it is easier to understands by git that from which point local and gitHub files are gone different and starts the speical merge process.
