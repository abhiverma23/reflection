When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I will use it when I am out of my home or not having my laptop with me and when I need to work with my friends

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This might curropt my files in local repos. so for me it is better to do this when I want to.
